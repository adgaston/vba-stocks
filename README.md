# VBA & the Stock Market
Using VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data


Used test data to develop scripts & ran final scripts on large dataset

Created a script that:
- Looped through each year of stock data
- Grabbed the total volume amount each stock had over the year
- Included the ticker symbol
